The Dataset consists of 9240 observations and 37 columns in total. The Dataset is acquired by X Education using an online survey form. There are several numerical variables like Total visits per customer, Total time spent on the website, Pages viewed on the website and several categorical variables include Lead origin, Lead source, Occupation, Reason for choosing the course and Last notable activity. Our target variable here is “Converted” which is a categorical variable. The variable Converted tells us if the customer has successfully bought the service or not.

Inferences: Total time spent on the website has a significant relation with the decision of conversion, whereas Total visits isn’t a variable of great importance. X Education should strategize their website content more to make customers stay for longer periods of time on their website. There is a significant difference between observed and expected frequencies in all the lead origins. Moreover, the company should focus more on generating leads through Lead Import.
